# Task: Predicting prices of stays

After a long period of global pandemic and lockdown, more and more people are choosing to spend their vacations in a different way than before.
There is more interest in renting facilities by private owners, who can do so through online platforms that are gaining popularity, among others.
With the overall increase in travel costs, the price of accommodation is becoming an extremely important factor. 
Therefore, we have prepared for you a task related to the prediction of prices of stays. 
Your goal, using data from one of the leading websites of its kind, will be to create an effective model for predicting accommodation prices.

You will be considering:
* Data preprocessing.
* Interpretability of the model.
* Visualisations of the results.
* Overfitting analysis
* Effectiveness of the model (in various metrics)

The final evaluation consists of the code and a presentation that will include the results of the work.
